            It was originally part of the Azande Kingdom and was the earliest part of South Sudan infl uenced by Christian missionaries. It has so
        far managed to stay relatively unaffected by the ongoing civil war, but there is no infrastructure whatsoever.</p>
        <p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">
        It is a thick rainforest full of mahogany and other exotic trees, and the soil is remarkably fruitful. Hunger is not the most pressing issue,
        but there are almost no education facilities and job opportunities are scarce. These factors contribute to increasing frustrations in the
        youth, increasing the odds they will become involved with armed confl ict.</p>

        For this reason, it is a potential candidate for Value Villages. We have a reliable partner organization in the local Catholic Diocese and
        the full support of the newly established county government. The ten locations were chosen according to accessibility from the
        Catholic Mission of Nboko which can be used as a base of operations.

poverty, according to the recent World Poverty Clock report. According to the report, Turkana County in the northern Kenia has the
largest number of people living below the poverty line with 87.4 per cent (800.000 people).

        <p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">
           Turkana County has about 1 Million inhabitants and are nomadic pastoralists who mainly keep cattle, donkeys, camels and goats. The
animals are their main source of food and wealth. They are the second largest pastoral community in Kenya after the Maasai people.
<p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">
        Hilfsverein Nymphenburg has been active there since 2012 fi nancing water projects and schools, and we have a stable network of
partner organizations. At four of the ten choosen villages, the Hilfsverein has already implemented projects, and counting in our
partner organizations even at eight of the ten. This is therefore the perfect area to roll out the new Value Villages plan.</p>
