            Value Villages is a project initiated by Stiftung Hilfsverein Nymphenburg and its partner
organizations, on the ground and internationally.
        </p>
        <p>
            The funding for our action plan will mostly come from the donor organizations (e.g. Stiftung
Hilfsverein Nymphenburg) directly to our local partner organization (e.g. Diocese of Lodwar to
construct and operate a school). There are some activities, concerning the Fair Trade activities
and the project supervision that will be run by Value Villages as an organization itself. For this
purpose, we will set up a non-profi t company, registered in Germany with subsidiaries in Turkana
and in South Sudan. Hilfsverein Nymphenburg will retain a controlling interest in this non-profi t
company
        </p>
        <p>
            The mandate of the Value Villages organization will be to select new locations, coordinate
between partner organizations, train and employ the Value Managers and facilitate the logistics
and international sales necessary for the Fair Trade program to work.
