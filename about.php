                    Within the next 25 years the population of Africa will roughly double from 1
to 2 Billion, most babies being born in rural villages. These rapidly growing
Communities can either become desert slums dependent on Western Food
Aid, or… Value Villages.

                    Since 2011 the German foundation Hilfsverein Nymphenburg has made East
Africa one of its focus regions for funding projects. Our special advantage
was, that we were working with a variety of very different partner
organizations, such as Catholic Missionaries, Agriculture Organizations from
Israel, local governments, and small Self-Help groups from local
communities. All of them had a different structure and approach to tackle
the same basic problems
                </p>
                <p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">
                    In 2018 the Board decided to use all this experience, including the
knowledge of all our partners, to create a new framework for our projects:
Value Villages. It will bring about a better cooperation between our partner
organizations and help to fill in the gaps on the path to more sustainable
development, with new and specifically designed projects that aim to tackle
adult education and income generation. Value Villages will officially be
launched on the 85th Birthday of Duke Francis of Bavaria, the Chairman of
Hilfsverein Nymphenburg and for the first time be presented at the Charity
Auction Helfen ohne Limit.

                <h3 class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">The Problem</h3>
                <p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up"><i>Vast areas of the African continent are so cut off from education and
development, that it seems almost impossible to catch up with the rest of
the world.</i></p>
<p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">
    Rural nomadic villages in Africa have the greatest proportion of people living
in extreme poverty. For example, in Turkana County, the area of our pilot
project, more than 95% of the population live on less than $1 a day
</p>
<p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">
    The regions’ environmental, epidemiological and geographical challenges -
including low-productivity agriculture, a high disease burden, lack of a
context-based education system and the high transport costs render these
communities vulnerable to persistent extreme poverty. This means that
there is lack of basic needs; for example, to collect safe drinking water, if it is
to be found at all, people must walk several miles every day.
</p>
<p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">
    With these rural communities stuck in a cycle of poverty, they are unable to
make investments into human capital and infrastructure that is required to
achieve self-sustaining economic growth. For many years, people and
development agencies in Turkana County, like the rest of northern Kenya,
have worked at alleviating extreme poverty so that the poorest people can
access basic goods and services for survival; like food, safe drinking water,
sanitation, shelter and education. Many organizations and the government
are providing aid, but often on an emergency need basis, rather than long
term sustainable planning. This can even make the situation worse, since it
creates dependency while increasing the demographic problem.

                <h3 class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">Why Value Villages?</h3>
                <p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up"><i>We cannot help everybody, but we can see through what we
start. </i></p>
<p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">
    Rather than trying to solve this problem for the entire region,
we look at that one village at the time. We make sure that the
selected communities receive not just punctual aid that will
increase their dependency, but a full set of measures that will
eventually help them to become self-sufficient. We are providing
a long-term plan which includes road access, clean water, health,
education and business opportunities. 
</p>
<p class="aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up">
    The role of Value Villages is to coordinate between partner
organizations to make this happen and to provide the
management and follow up on the ground. If there is no partner
organization available for certain aspects of the plan, for example
income generation for the illiterate part of the villagers, Value
Villages steps in with its own programs, like vocational training
and international Fair Trade of locally manufactured products.
Over a 10-year period spanning two five-year phases, value
villages will have developed community committee
’
s capacity to
continue these initiatives and develop a solid foundation for
sustainable growth.

                    Our focus is on remote communities of 100 to 500 households
that have little or no connection to the developed world. We are
looking at illiteracy levels of up to 95 % for adults, and for children
in many cases they have no access to schools. The average
household income is less than one US $ per day, and there is
currently little to no other economic income. The normal way of
living is in “Manyattas”, simple houses constructed out of palm
leaves or other available materials, and in many cases, there is no
access to medication and medical services. Most of these
communities already receive food aid, which has allowed for the
community population to grow, but now have become unable to
sustain themselves with their livestock or other traditional
methods. The first four locations picked, do not start at zero, as
they have already benefited from projects of the Hilfsverein
Nymphenburg; such as water solutions and early childhood
education. Currently approximately 1200 Households in the four
different sites in northern Kenya are beneficiaries of these
projects. Each Value Village site is located in a distinct location
with numerous challenges. Create a Vision for each individual
Village For every Community we welcome into the program we
first develop a Village Vision.
